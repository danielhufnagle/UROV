## Frames
These are just your basic $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes and where you place them and how you orient them. On a robot, you'll typically see a *space frame* $\{s\}$ - a fixed global frame from which we define the robot's configuration, and a *body frame* $\{b\}$ - a frame attached to the robot itself. Commonly, you'll also end up seeing frames attached to the robot's joints and end effector as well.

## Rotation and transformation matrices
We've already defined the space and body frame. So now the question is how we describe these frames relative to each other and move a frame from one place to another. In robotics, we do this with matrices. The rotation matrix describes the orientation of one frame relative to another.

$$R_{sb} = \begin{bmatrix}\hat{x}_b & \hat{y}_b & \hat{z}_b\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}x_{bx} & y_{bx} & z_{bx} \\ x_{by} & y_{by} & z_{by} \\ x_{bz} & y_{bz} & z_{bz}\end{bmatrix}\in SO(3)$$

Note that the first subscript is the frame of reference and the second is the frame whose orientation is being represented. $\hat{x}_b$, $\hat{y}_b$, and $\hat{z}_b$ are the unit coordinate axes of $\{b\}$ expressed in $\{s\}$ written as column vectors.

Some basic operations and properties of rotation matrices are shown here:
*Inverse and transpose*

$$R^{-1}=R^T$$

*Composition and subscript cancellation*

$$R_{ab}=R_{as}R_{ab}$$

*Representing a point in a reference frame*

$$p_s = R_{sb}p_b$$

*Rotation*
Let $R_{sb}=R$ be a rotation matrix

$$p'_s=Rp_s=R_{sb}p_s$$

is the rotation of point $p_s$

$$RR_{sc}=R_{sb}R_{sc}$$

rotates frame $\{c\}$ about the axes of $\{s\}$

$$R_{sc}R=R_{sc}R_{sb}$$

rotates frame $\{c\}$ about the axes of $\{c\}$

Now, it's one thing to express and modify orientations, but we need to also be able to specify positions too. This is where the transformation matrix comes in.

$$T_{sb}=\begin{bmatrix}R_{sb} & p_{sb} \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & p_1 \\ r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & p_2 \\ r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & p_3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\in SE(3)$$

$R_{sb}$ is the rotation matrix specifying the orientation of $\{b\}$ in $\{s\}$ and $p_{sb}$ is the position of the origin of $\{b\}$ in $\{s\}$. Note the bottom row is the way it is to simplify matrix operations.

Transformation matrices follow much of the same properties and operations of a rotation matrix
*Inverse*

$$T^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}R^T & -R^Tp \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$

*Composition and subscript cancellation*

$$T_{ab} = T_{as}T_{sb}$$

*Representing a point in a frame*

$$p_{s}=T_{sb}\begin{bmatrix}p_b \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$$

Because the point is a 3-vector, we need to append a 1 so that we can perform the multiplication.

*Transformation*

$$TT_{sc}=T_{sb}T_{sc}$$

transforms frame $\{c\}$ by first rotating about the axes of $\{s\}$ and then translating along the axes of $\{s\}$

$$T_{sc}T=T_{sc}T_{sb}$$

transforms frame $\{c\}$ by first translating along the axes of $\{c\}$ and then rotating about the axes of $\{c\}$

## Screws and twists
In robotics, we define motion as rotation about a screw axis. A screw is defined as such

$$\mathcal{S}=\begin{bmatrix}\mathcal{S}_{\omega} \\ \mathcal{S}_{v}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\mathcal{S}_{\omega x} \\ \mathcal{S}_{\omega y} \\ \mathcal{S}_{\omega z} \\ \mathcal{S}_{vx} \\ \mathcal{S}_{vy} \\ \mathcal{S}_{vz}\end{bmatrix}$$

$\mathcal{S}_{\omega}$ is the angular velocity when the speed of rotation about it $\dot{\theta}=1$ and $\mathcal{S}_v$ is the linear velocity of the origin when $\dot{\theta}=1$

$\mathcal{S}_\omega$ can be better defined as the axis of rotation (as a unit vector or the zero vector) and $\mathcal{S}_v$ is the is the vector tangent to the circle whose origin is at the screw axis and touches the origin of the frame we are describing the axis in in the direction of rotation about the axis.

Note that if the pitch of a screw is infinite, the rotational component will be 0 and the linear component will be a unit vector corresponding to the direction of linear motion. 

The twist is the representation of velocity for frames / rigid bodies, given by

$$\mathcal{V}=\mathcal{S}\dot{\theta}$$

$$\mathcal{V}t=\mathcal{S}\theta$$

This is to say that following a twist for a certain period of time is equivalent to rotating about a screw axis for a certain angle.

To change a twist's frame of reference, we need to adjust for the dimension mismatch as a transformation matrix is 4x4 and a twist is a 6-vector. To do this, we use the *adjoint representation* of the transformation matrix

$$[Ad_T]=\begin{bmatrix}R & 0 \\ [p]R & R\end{bmatrix}$$

where

$$[p] = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -p_z & p_y \\ p_z & 0 & -p_x \\ -p_y & p_x & 0\end{bmatrix}$$

So now we can say

$$\mathcal{V}_s=[Ad_T{_{sb}}]\mathcal{V}_b$$

## Exponential coordinates of rigid body motion
Moving a frame about a screw axis for a certain angle, or having a frame experience a twist for a period of time, is represented with *exponential coordinates* using the *matrix exponential*, shown below.

$$e^{[\mathcal{S}]\theta}=\mathcal{e}^{[\mathcal{V}]t}$$

where 

$$[\mathcal{V}]=\begin{bmatrix}[\omega] & v \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$

where 

$$[\omega]=\begin{bmatrix}0 & -\omega_z & \omega_y \\ \omega_x & 0 & -\omega_z \\ -\omega_y & \omega_x & 0\end{bmatrix}$$

The notation for $[\mathcal{S}]$ is the same.
The actual closed forms of the matrix exponentials are given below
*purely translational motion*

$$e^{[\mathcal{S}]\theta}=\begin{bmatrix}I & \mathcal{S}_v\theta \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$

*rotation + translation*

$$e^{[\mathcal{S}]\theta}=\begin{bmatrix}e^{[\mathcal{S}_\omega]\theta} & (I\theta+(1-cos\theta)[\mathcal{S}_\omega]+(\theta-sin\theta)[\mathcal{S}_\omega]^2)\mathcal{S}_v \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$

where

$$e^{[\mathcal{S}_\omega]\theta}=I+sin\theta[\mathcal{S}_\omega]+(1 - cos\theta)[\mathcal{S}_\omega]^2$$

The matrix exponential yields a transformation matrix. 
If the screw axis is represented in the body frame

$$T_{sb'}=T_{sb}e^{[\mathcal{S}_b]\theta}=T_{sb}e^{[\mathcal{V}_b]t}$$

If the screw axis is represented in the space frame

$$T_{sb'}=e^{[\mathcal{S_s}]\theta}T_{sb}=e^{[\mathcal{V}_s]t}T_{sb}$$

## Forward kinematics
Using the matrix exponential, we can represent the forward kinematics of a robot. Let's first define the matrix $M$ as the home configuration of the robot - the transformation $T_{sb}$ when all joint angles $\theta=0$.

Given every joint is a screw axis, with a list of joint angles, we can drive the robot to its final configuration.
If the screw axes are represented in $\{s\}$

$$T(\theta)=e^{[\mathcal{S}_1]\theta}...e^{[\mathcal{S}_n]\theta}M$$

If the screw axes are represented in $\{b\}$

$$T(\theta)=Me^{[\mathcal{S}_1]\theta}...e^{[\mathcal{S}_n]\theta}$$
