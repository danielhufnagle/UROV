## Task 1: A Kaleidoscope of corals in cold water
1. Collect species from the coral garden
	1. Collect two basket stars and return them to the surface, side of the pool
	2. Collect two coral species and return them to the surface, side of the pool
2. Coral garden ridge modelling
	1. Via photogrammetry, autonomously create a scaled 3D model of the coral garden
		1. Create a 3D model of the coral garden
		2. Measure the length of the coral garden within 5 cm
		3. Scale the 3D model using the length of the coral garden
		4. Use the properly scaled 3D model to estimate the height of the coral garden
	2. Manually (CAD) create a scaled 3D model of the coral garden
		1. Measure the length of the coral garden
		2. Measure the height of the coral garden
		3. Create a scaled 3D model of the coral restoration area displaying the length and height measurements
	3. Manually create a 3-view technical drawing of the coral restoration area
		1. Measure the length of the coral garden
		2. Measure the height of the coral garden
		3. Create a technical drawing on paper of the coral garden, including the measured length and height with at least 3 views (top, front, side)
3. Fly a transect over the coral garden
	1. Fly a transect to create a video of the coral garden
## Task 2: Better information, better decisions
1. Mitigate invasive species
	1. Determine the number of invasive European Green crabs in the sample
		1. Using image recognition
		2. Manually
	2. Upload the data to the invasive species form
2. Iceberg tracking
	1. Track icebergs headed towards offshore oil platforms
		1. Survey iceberg at five points around its perimeter
			1. Survey all 5 points
			2. Survey one to four points
		2. Measure the keep depth of the iceberg within 10 cm of true depth
		3. Use the location, heading, and keel depth to determine the threat level of the iceberg to the four area oil platforms
			1. Determine the threat level to the offshore platform
			2. Determine the threat level to the offshore platform's subsea assets
3. Testing whale safe fishing gear
	1. Turn the handle to simulate the acoustic release of the retrieval buoy
		1. Recover the lobster pot off the bottom
		2. Return the lobster pot to the surface, side of the pool
4. Recover the buoy anchor
	1. Attach a recovery line to the buoy anchor
	2. Return the line to the surface, side of the pool
5. Service the Holyrood subsea observatory
	1. Recover the old eDNA sensor
		1. Recover the old sensor to the surface, side of the pool
		2. Analyze the sensor's data to determine the percent frequency seen of various organisms
	2. Install a new eDNA sensor
		1. Place the sensor in the designated area
		2. Connect the sensor to the Holyrood subsea observatory
	3. Remove biofouling from the Holyrood subsea observatory camera
## Task 3: Wind-powered offshore oil platform: scalable solutions for global energy needs
1. Micropile installation
	1. Install a micropile to the seafloor to secure the wind turbine
		1. Place a bubble curtain device around the micropile designated location
		2. Guide a micropile to the designated location
		3. Pull. a pin to release the micropile
2. Powering an oil platform from a wind turbine
	1. Connect the wind farm power connector to the oil platform
		1. Retrieve the power connector from the wind farm subsea station
		2. Lay the power connector cable through a waypoint away from the micropile
		3. Remove the cover from the oil platform port
		4. Install the power connector into the oil platform port
## Task 4: MATE floats under ice
1. Prior to competition, design and construct a vertical profiling float
2. Float communicates with the station prior to descending
3. Float completes two vertical profiles under the ice
	1. Profile 1
		1. Float completes first vertical profile
			1. Using a buoyancy engine
			2. Using a different mechanism
		2. Float maintains a depth of 2.5 meters for 30 seconds
		3. Float maintains a depth of 40 cm for 30 seconds
			1. Do not let float break the surface or contact the ice sheet
	2. Profile 2
		1. Same as profile 1
4. After recovery, float communicates with (transmits data autonomously to) the station
	1. Float communicates to the mission station
		1. Float communicates all data packets
		2. Float communicate at least one data packet
	2. Profile is graphed as depth over time
5. Company does not design and construct a vertical profiling float, or float does not communicate data to the mission station after recovery
